# React-typescript / Game-site:video_game:

This is a simple demo project made for study purpose.
You can try sample from here.:point_right:
[Go to demo site](https://react-typescript-game-site.web.app/)

I Used Free RestApi :
[Free-To-Play Games Database API](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc)

If you want try code by your own, you need API_KEY.

1. Create hosting service's account ( like [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/digiwalls/api/free-to-play-games-database) ) and get API_KEY.
2. Create `appsettings.ts` under `src/` and export your key.

```
export const RAPID_API_KEY = "YOUR API_KEY";
```

#### What do I use in this project :

- React
- TypeScript
- webpack
- babel
- eslint
- styled-component
- how to include .svg files
